          <h3>Introduction</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear
          structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering
          development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop
          applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++ is fun and
          easy to learn!
        </p>

        <p>
          C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create
          high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup,
          as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level
          of control over system resources and memory. The language was updated
          3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.

          <h3>What you should already know</h3>
        </header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of basic computing</li>
          <li>
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
            of the tutorials linked on the main page about C++
          </li>
          <li>
            You should be familiar with atleast one compiler (e.g
            <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">atom</a>,
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank"

          <h3>C++ and C#</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          As a much more modern programming language, C# was designed to work
          with the current Microsoft .NET framework in both client and web-based
          applications. While C++ is an object-oriented language, C# is
          considered a component-oriented programming language. Object-oriented
          programming concentrates on the associations between classes that link
          together into a big binary executable, while component-oriented
          programming uses exchangeable code modules that work on their own and
          don’t need you to know their inner workings to use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          While C and C# are technically related to each other, they’re
          enormously different languages, so there are more differences than
          similarities between them. Having a background in C can be useful for
          learning C# because some of the syntaxes are similar; however, C#’s
          syntax is so forgiving that you could easily learn it without knowing
          C at all.

          <h3>Hello world</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Most of the code you encounter while learning C++ can be run using
          simple text input with text output directly to a console window.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is how you create an empty console project in Visual Studio 2017:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Launch Visual Studio 2017.</li>
          <li>On the menu bar, choose File, New, Project.</li>
          <li>
            In the Visual C++ category, choose Empty Project and then name the
            project. Choose a name that gives some indication of contents – for
            example, “HelloWorld” for a tutorial or “GuessTheNumber” for a
            number guessing application
          </li>
          <li>
            In Solution Explorer, right-click Source Files then choose Add, New
            Item.
            <br />
            <img
              src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/t1-add-cpp-file-500x330.jpg"
              alt="A screenshot from the visual studio working page"
              class="section-image"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            In Add New Item, choose C++ File (.cpp) and then name the file.
            Again, the name should reflect the file contents. For example,
            “HelloWorld” for tutorial code or “WidgetClass” for the Widget
            implementation. Click Add.
          </li>
          <li>
            You now have an empty project ready for tutorial code or other C or
            C++ code. If you want basic template code that will build and is
            suitable for experimentation, copy the code below into the new C++
            file, then press CTRL-F5 to build and run.
            <code class="standout-code">
              <br />
              int main() { <br />
              &nbsp; return 0; <br />
              }<br />
            </code>
            This code is nothing more than an empty shell, ready for your
            exploration into C++.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The following program writes Hello world to the screen(console)</p>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <p>
            int main() { <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; cout&lt;&lt; "Hello World"; <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; return 0; <br />
            &nbsp; }
          </p>
        </div>

      <section class="main-section" id="variables">
        <header>
          <h3>Variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
          A C++ identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar
          sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because C++
          is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
          (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
        <header>
          <h3>Declaring variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          You have to announce each variable to C++ before you can use it. You
          have to say something soothing like this:
          <code class="standout-code">
            <p>int x;</p>
            <p>x = 10;</p>
            <p>int y;</p>
            <p>y = 5;</p>
          </code>
          These lines of code declare that a variable x exists, is of type int,
          and has the value 10; and that a variable y of type int also exists
          with the value 5
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
        <header>
          <h3>Variable scope</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
        <header>
          <h3>Global variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          We covered that local variables are variables defined inside a
          function (or function parameters). Local variables have block scope
          (are only visible within the block they are declared in), and have
          automatic duration (they are created at the point of definition and
          destroyed when the block is exited). In C++, variables can also be
          declared outside of a function. Such variables are called
          <b>global variables</b>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="constants">
        <header>
          <h3>Constants</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and
          they are called literals. Constants can be of any of the basic data
          types and can be divided into Integer Numerals, Floating-Point
          Numerals, Characters, Strings and Boolean Values. Again, constants are
          treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be
          modified after their definition.
        </p>
        <p>There are two simple ways in C++ to define constants −</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Using <b>#define</b> preprocessor.</li>
          <li>Using <b>const</b> keyword.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using #define preprocessor to define a constant −</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <p>#define IDENTIFIER value</p>
        </div>

        <p>Using #const preprocessor to define a constant −</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <p>const type variable = value;</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
        <header>
          <h3>Data types</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          In C++, data types are declarations for variables. This determines the
          type and size of data associated with variables. For example,
        </p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <code> int age = 13; </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Here, <i>age</i> is a variable of type <i>int</i>. Meaning, the
          variable can only store integers of either 2 or 4 bytes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The table below shows the fundamental data types, their meaning, and
          their sizes (in bytes):
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Data Types</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
            <th>Size(in Bytes)</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>int</td>
            <td>Integer</td>
            <td>2 or 4</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>float</td>
            <td>Floating point</td>
            <td>4</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>double</td>
            <td>Double floating-point</td>
            <td>8</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>char</td>
            <td>Character</td>
            <td>1</td>

            <td>Boolean</td>
            <td>1</td>

          <tr>
            <td>void</td>
            <td>Empty</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statements">
        <header>
          <h3>If...else statements</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <code>
            if (condition) { <br />
            &nbsp; statement_1; <br />
            } else { <br />
            &nbsp; statement_2; <br />
            }
          </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <code>
            if (condition_1) { <br />
            &nbsp; statement_1;<br />
            } else if (condition_2) { <br />
            &nbsp; statement_2; <br />
            } else if (condition_n) { <br />
            &nbsp; statement_n; <br />
            } else { <br />
            &nbsp; statement_last; <br />
            }
          </code>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statements">
        <header>
          <h3>While statements</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <p>
            while (condition) {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statement <br />
            }
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
          executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. The
          condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the
          condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
          control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>

        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
          group those statements.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
          The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
        </p>

        <div class="code-snippet">
          <code>
            int n = 0; <br />
            int x = 0; <br /><br />
            while (n &lt; 3) { <br />
            &nbsp; n++; <br />
            &nbsp; x += n; <br />
            }</code
          >
        </div>

        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>
          <h3>Function declarations</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The function return data type (it can also be a <i>void</i> if the
            function returns no value)
          </li>
          <li>The name of the function</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The C++ statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
            brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named

            double function square(number) { <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return (number * number); <br />

          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <code>return number * number;</code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
          changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
          globally or in the calling function.
